I have went through a lot of hardship in sobriety, but through the support and Love of the Fellowship I never made an excuse to pick up. My Serenity is directly proportional to my Spiritual fitness today, and I made the decision to feel serene every 24 hours, regardless of my circumstances.

After he got clean, he couldn\'t keep it private, if he wanted to continue making music. The traditions are there for a reason, but I think this wasn\'t really considered here. His job and his passion is to make music about himself. If he wants to fully stick to the traditions, he will lose that, which might drive him closer to a relapse. Or he could just make music about it and maybe help others overcome their addiction, while still working on his own.\n\nAlso, to be fair, he never celebrated his sobriety on social media like this before, he only talked about it in interviews, rapped about it in his music to help others, or publicly wore his sobriety necklace, but AFAIK he never publicly celebrated it until now. And to be fair, the only controversies he\'s been in in the last decade were all for his music/art and not his behavior or drug addiction.\n\nAlso FYI: Even though he\'s 10 years sober now he still def considers himself as an addict and even recently said that he was on the verge of relapse \\(on ""In Your Head""\\).\n\nI\'m not trying to be disrespectful to anyone here, I just wanted to give you another point of view.

Perhaps this was even helped along by the success and establishment of AA.\n\nHowever, in searching for the truth(what this program was built upon) do we not also miss out on the truths/impacts within AA? I mean, its hard to gauge the success rate of this program? There is no data or statistics. In that sense does the anonymity skew the data and its findings at all?  Also, the average person is going to try any course to get better...I know I did. Fortunately I was able to find some other means of recovery to get my life back.

That is a trademark logo.. it’s a clear violation of tradition 11. \n  This stuff always makes me think of Charlie Sheen.

Again, the most popular post on here is a guy calling people concerned about the traditions an asshole. \n   I hope you stick around long enough and listen hard enough to hear what this program really is.

You’d be misjudging if you did. \n   Fascinating to note that no one says a word when another calls someone who defends the traditions an asshole or a faggot or says to wait for them to die. But you jump on anyone else. That’s the problem. People can say whatever they like in criticizing this program, but how dare someone counter that with literature describing what this really is. ', 'back in the day the stigma of alcoholism had a bit more consequence in society.\n\nPeople would not want to do business with you because of trust, responsibilities, moral perception etc..\n\nFortunately its a lot less hostile but people can easily still hold prejudice against anyone for any reason.\n\nI know pretty much everyone in my meetings so that anonymity dissolved over time. But even when comfortable with one another its good practice to keep things private in public out of respect. \n\nIts great you have such an interest in the traditions. Learning how AA came to be is an amazing story in itself, and learning how each tradition came to be because of disorder and controversy came to be. \n\nI like to think of it as the early years of the US, a lot of unforseen issues came apparent very early on and the strife it created before there were even political parties.', 'He’s not breaking tradition of he went on tv then he would ', 'Where does it say Alcohoics Anonymous.', ""What you just said about AA can be held to any group or organization. This has to do more with people treating celebrities like there's some kind of Gods on a pedestal rather than normal people. It's my personal belief that just because you have Celebrity Status does not mean you should be exempt to being a human being and should not be scrutinized for participating and Simple Pleasures enjoys that we all do and should not be scrutinized for participating and Simple Pleasures enjoys that we all do, such as sharing success."", 'You definitely didn\'t let me down! Once again I agree with everything you\'ve said here. The guy who told you to talk to your sponsor...wouldn\'t it be interesting to hear a newcomer say that to your face at a meeting? \n\nBack to your original post, what I should have said in reply to you is that there\'s probably a more effective way to communicate your disagreement. I\'m not sure if that more effective way is simply a more ""PC"" way. I think to times when my wife & I are arguing and I got her dead to rights in the argument but then I call her a name or say something else regrettable. All of a sudden it doesn\'t matter if I have a point, or if I was changing hearts & minds, because the focus is on that regrettable thing I said. Now I\'M the asshole. \n', 'Yeah I can’t even tell you how many times I’ve seen someone start out by saying they have been sober less than a year then go on to talk about how the traditions are useless. And the problem is that this is the internet so conversations work the same way as they do anywhere else on the internet. It so useless to try to explain these things to people. And you can say go speak to your sponsor.. except you know their sponsor is someone who probably thinks the traditions are a waste of time too...\n\nWhatever though, they’ll probably all drink long before their disregard for the traditions harms aa. ', 'I’ll reflect on what you said and I apologize for the name calling. It was unnecessary. I agree that what we do is important and that the traditions were not put in place to be ignored. I don’t necessarily agree with your way of going about things but I agree with what you say. ', 'Or print or radio, that’s what the tradition says. It was written long before social media existed. I’d argue that more people saw this post than would have listened to a radio program ', '> it\'s meant to be anonymous to protect your individualism\n\nThis was from your previous reply but I dont quite sure what that means and i don\'t want to assume and delve further into this quagmire of misunderstanding.  There is a side of Anonymity that protects an individual from being ""outed"" as a member, and the other side is to protect AA as a whole from unneeded criticism and slander that comes from individuals selfishly promoting the program. \n\nThe principle behind this tradition is humility. One of the baffling things about addicts and alcoholics is that we generally want praise and accolades over not self-destructing anymore. ', 'Go read the extensive literature on what anonymity means to AA. This is literally the epitome of why it’s wrong. You clearly don’t understand this tradition, and I suppose that’s alright if you are new, but this is PRECISELY why anonymity is a thing. It’s not just about the “person”.. anonymity protects  the group as a whole, which is way more important that Eminem’s or your thoughts about it. \n   Read the material and it’s clear. ', 'No no. I understand what you’re saying and you’re right. My sponsor gets on me all the time about this site.. “you can’t find enough people to be pissed at in our homegroup so you have to go online?” - it’s sort of a running joke. But I also know how he feels about the traditions.. it’s where I learned them. And he’d be the first to pipe up if someone said shit like this in a meeting. \n   Maybe it’s just my Montana Irish coming out. I shouldn’t resort to names.. but I’ll counter anti-AA if I see it on here. I don’t do it on other Recovery subs because that’s their scene.. but I reckon people who come to an AA sub should hear what is real AA. And that’s easy.. it’s all written down. ', 'Hey good job on the humility and honesty bro/sis.', 'Why don’t you go get a tissue for your hurt vag ', '> I reckon people who come to an AA sub should hear what is real AA. And that’s easy.. it’s all written down.\n\nBut what about muh feelings...???', 'I totally agree with this. This is an AA sub and it should be AA. If you want watered down group therapy and we don’t like it so let’s not do it, go to Stop Drinking, etc. I’m still new in sobriety, but I’m so grateful that my home group and Sponsor are AA all the way. I’m constantly amazed at the amount of people who want to pick an argument with us versus just going off and doing their own thing their own way. It’s as if they honestly can’t comprehend that it’s attraction not promotion and that we’re not here to talk anyone into anything BUT if you start taking a dump all over what we have, then we’re pretty much obligated to set the record straight. \n\nThe way I see it is that AA is not changing. I don’t know where folks get the idea that sticking to the 164 pages is strictly an old timer thing. Not where I’ve been, and I’ve been to meetings in different states and countries. Young, old, black, white, purple people are able to grasp the effectiveness and absolute critical need to keep it as is. That’s what I’ve seen, anyway. I’ve seen it works for so many and having just passed a year, I’m beginning to have my life back. It’s truly a gift. ', 'Lol judging by your lack of a substantive retort it’s pretty obvious thag your vag is hurt haha I’m not invested in this, I just have a different opinion backed up not by dissagreeableness but by logic ', 'Lol. You could try telling your sponsor, I suppose. Provided he’s nothing like mine! It’s always a treat to hear his retort when we talk about my feelings. ', 'Oh yeah. This sub is filled with it. As if this is a constitutional rights debate. This movement has traditions that have allowed this thing to not perish. Bill Wilson said “ can we now declare general principles which could grow into VITAL traditions- traditions sustained in the heart of each AA by his own conviction and by the common consent of his fellows?” \n   That’s a powerful statement. And people that do service know and respect the fact that this stuff is discussed and voted on at the district, Area and all the way up. And the end product of that vote has remained the same. If AA as a whole decided that nonalcoholics can join AA, or, that it’s ok for anyone, including celebrities, to openly display themselves as AA members, then I, as a member of AA, will have to reconcile that. Until then, It’s a non-argument to me. These people that think their wants and needs trump AA’s right to its own destiny is selfish to the core. And what does our book say about selfishness? It must be conquered or we die. That’s what it says. \n  Traditions... all day long. They are that important. ', 'Ohhh you used the word retort you’re so smart.  Eminem is not breaking anonymity on the level of press radio and films so shut the hell up you faggot ', 'I know his exact response because I\'ve heard it so many times: ""I don\'t remember the chapter titled ""how mnhoops feels"" in the Big Book."" It\'s his second favorite line to ""time takes time.""', 'So what is more important? The newcomer? The group? The traditions? Im asking because it seems as if they...do not fit so easily. I am asking because I have just entered the program. \n\nAllow this thought for a minute. In the 30’s alcoholism and mental health were not very well understood. Much less accepted. To this day, mental health is very misunderstood and unsupported. Isnt that a part of why anonymity was so important back then? Because it fostered a safe space for honesty? I am grateful AA continues to exist.  I realize The traditions help with that persistence. However, isn’t it because there arent many other places to go? Because of the anonymity, AA fails to report its successes. And what constitutes a “success” anyway? As someone who got sober outside the rooms of AA, I ventured in later and life and understand the appeal. In fact I am still learning, as I have been in AA for less than 1 yr.  however, if the traditions and the steps and sponsor ship would have been shown to me ten years ago, I may not have accepted such a gift. \n\nSo I would really like to know what your thoughts are on these traditions? IE, isn’t selfishness/self centeredness apart of human nature? Is it not ethical(unethical) only if we “run over” another human being to get what we want? In that case yes it is wrong. However, what about setting healthy boundaries for ourselves? If someone bothers you at a meeting don’t you have the right to not help them, while being healthy. Say someone is loud and obnoxious at a meeting? Isn’t up to us as healthy people to talk to him off to the side and explain about not disrupting the group? Or are you justified in telling that person to get the hell out (I have seen this in real time). Isnt that a selfish thing in itself? \n\nSorry for all of the questions. I guess in a way I an selfish for wanting to learn? Or maybe Im not a good fit for AA? I dont know....,\n\n', 'Hahaha cheers ', 'Sounds like a good man. ', 'Well at the end of the day, the group must come first. If not, there is no group. Newcomers are super important and if you come to my homegroup you’ll see. I work with newcomers every single day. But the idea that anyone, newcomer or not, is more important than the group as a whole is absurd. When we say “principles before personality” it means just that.  \n   So a newcomer comes in and has some questions, argued, and is even disruptive... ok... happens all the time. I did it too. I do what was done to me. I talk to them after a meeting, welcome them back, encourage them to take the steps, etc. \n   But what they WONT get, is an alteration of this program to suit their needs.. suiting there needs hasn’t  worked so well, right? What AA actually IS is very clearly laid out in literature available to anyone who cares to read it. And these traditions? Weren’t just scratched on a napkin. They were the result of years of experience.. and, they have stood the test of time. \n  So, at the end of the day, I have a choice to make: am I going to do this thing the way it says to do it? And get the results it promises? Or, am I going to do my own thing, and complain and argue that I’m not getting what I want? \n   No one has to be here.. there are other methods that aren’t spiritual, have no traditions, whatever.. those are out there too. But, this is AA and this is what we do. AA is the 164 pages in that book. That’s the program of recovery. It’s not meetings, Coffee and LaCroix. It’s the book. So when people come to AA and try to undermine that? I have something to say about it. If they don’t like the way this is laid out, then they don’t have to do it and they will get the results of that. \n   Were it not for traditions like unity, singleness of purpose, anonymity, etc, this thing would have died long ago.

Because I am willing to put in the work into my recovery. I go to meetings to be of service, I reach out to be their for my friends and family, I am rigorously honest. I pray and meditate. I work with others. I started doing these things when I was feeling well so it was easier to do them when I wasn't. These activities make me feel good and I was able to make that connect. I don't do these actions now because I am told to, I do them because I like the results. \n\nI say this to share my reality which is that my attitude and my overall happiness is based on the actions I am willing to take and the sacrifices I am willing to make.
