There's also the fact that the Zenin and the Gojo clans have had bad blood between them for centuries.

So they screwed up and the repercussions greatly affected society..,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jujutsushi/comments/n5lln3/so_they_screwed_up_and_the_repercussions_greatly/,34,1655,"[""Thinking back on the failed mission to protect the star plasma vessel, it really did set off a bad chain of events. Not only for jujutsu society and humanity as a whole but for the characters linked to this mission in particular.\n\n* Yaga - Though Yaga issued this mission to Gojo and Geto, his facial expressions and wording communicated his true feelings. His description of the star plasma vessel's 'erasure' caused the strongest duo to conclude something was not entirely right about the mission, affecting their decision to put Riko's freedom before anything else should she decide not to merge with Tengen. Much later, the higher ups used Yaga's relationship with his students as an excuse to charge him with the death penalty for inciting Satoru Gojo and Suguru Geto and causing the Shibuya incident.\n* Geto - Failure of the mission began Geto's downward spiral of doubt and disgust toward non-sorcerers. His run in with Toji influenced his contemptuous labelling of non-sorcerers as 'monkeys' and also allowed him to cross paths with the defeated mans 'Inventory' worm curse. Ingesting this cursed spirit was yet another reminder that a ritual so foul to Geto was akin to protecting non-sorcerers whom he despised. Following on from the incident he became a 'curse user' intent on ridding the world of non-sorcerers, eventually finding his demise at the hands of Okkotsu and his past best friend Gojo. Now reduced to being a mere tool, Geto's body and cursed spirit manipulation technique continue to be used in Kenjaku's plans.\n* Toji - By assassinating the star plasma vessel Toji prevented Tengen's merge, essentially being the catalyst for Kenjaku's laboriously laid out plans and the breakdown of jujutsu society. In fighting Gojo he wished to challenge one who represented the apex of jujutsu society itself, warping his usual self that had discarded any sense of pride or identity, leading to his death. Without Toji around Yuki Tsukumo couldn't gain further insight on zero cursed energy so easily and Megumi would grow up without his father or critical knowledge surrounding the Zen'in clan, eventually becoming the clan head under contentious circumstances. His actions would continue to ripple throughout the jujutsu world to the present day.\n* Gojo - During the mission, Gojo granted Riko more time in Okinawa by delaying their return trip due to either pity or his strong belief in youthful freedom. This played right into Toji's hands by wearing him down and also swayed Riko's desire to keep on living right before she was killed. Though he failed the mission, Gojo became the strongest sorcerer in his generation because of it, yet is arguably the person who suffered the most from this ordeal. The growing gap in strength and ideals between himself and Geto would lead to the loss of their friendship. His win against Toji would cause scrutiny to fall upon the inverted spear of heaven, eventually having it removed from the picture and from a future where it could be of use in freeing him from the prison realm. Gojo would also carry the burden of one day having to admit the truth to Megumi of his father's death. He is also yet to become aware of the lives lost during the Shibuya Incident and thereafter in his absence.\n\nI probably missed some more important details or might just be stating the obvious, but it's crazy to think that without Toji there would essentially be no plot and the Strongest Duo might have been exiled as 'curse users' on the run protecting Amanai Riko. Without Geto in Kenjaku's possession, something which was all too convenient in the grand scheme of things, his plans to use cursed manipulation on Tengen would be non-existent. Not to mention all these outcomes rested on the fate of one innocent girl. This mission was ultimately asking a lot. Even if those tasked with bearing it happened to be two special grade sorcerers."", ""After they screwed up, Gojo's line to kill everyone there who were clapping was straight-up frightening to see. One of the best arcs of the JJK manga."", 'Technically Toji didn’t prevent the merge of the vessel did he as both Geto and Gojo were willing to let her leave. Toji killed her just as she decided to not be merged if I remember correctly', 'someone made an always sunny title card for this on tik tok it just showed this panel then the title card said ""the gang screws up and the repercussions greatly affect society""', 'its cool how their opinions on the weak flipped after this arc', 'That’s lowkey sad', 'This is funny as hell', 'Slippery slope. But honestly I think Geto would’ve turned bad either way. Your true self always exists as is; there’s just something that triggers you to act properly (how you believe you should act) vs how you’re acting for other people.\n\nMy opinion at least.\n\nIt is crazy though.

Toji the greatest warrior.', 'This was a really good thread bro. Very nice work', 'Satoru waited too long to take care of Geto. Everything that’s happening in the show is Gino’s fault.', 'Toji fucked up everything, dude broke the chain of destiny', 'I have nothing to add but would like to say that this is an **amazing** summary, Good job!!', '>those tasked with bearing it happened to be two ~~special grade sorcerers.~~ *teenagers*', 'Damn, I was just gonna comment, ""Ah yes, the prophecy"", but this breakdown is absolutely insane!', ""This summary is Immaculate. You've basically covered everything perfectly. Great work."", 'I would like to see a fan fic of Geto and Gojo as curse users and protecting Riko.', 'It was a very eerie scene over all if not a little painful because Gojo was still unsure of how to act back then without Geto around as his moral compass. The Hidden Inventory arc is one that really shines more upon a second read through. The events at play, character developments and interactions gain even more impact after knowing how they fit into the bigger picture. There are still things to pick up on and re-assess even now.', ""Very true, but if we're going on technicalities then without Toji there would have been no bounty placed on Riko's head. No need to negotiate with kidnappers. No need to take the trip to Okinawa and have Riko enjoy her freedom. She would have spent time at school uninterrupted in Tokyo with probably only minor interactions with Gojo and Geto. Her desire to live may not have been swayed and the merge would probably have been carried out as planned. \n\nRegardless of her choice, Toji ended up killing the star plasma vessel. His presence alone became a huge factor if not the deciding one that prevented the merge."", 'That adds more pain', ""[The Gang Screws Up And Repercussions Greatly Affect Society](https://i.imgur.com/CKfc7dr.png)\n\n(I made this before I saw your comment so I'm happy someone else had the same idea)"", 'Please link this.

People's beliefs, ideologies, worldviews etc can change according to their choices and circumstances and that influences their actions."", 'Thank you, honestly I thought it might just sound like ramblings as the result of no new chapter to indulge in!', ""*Exactly.* It really highlights how messed up jujutsu society continues to be with the higher ups purposely issuing dangerous missions such as the one that caused Yuji's death during the cursed womb arc"", '100%  my second read through really made it my favorite part of the story so far.', 'Can you explain to me Gojo’s character development? I feel like he’s become more empathetic towards weak at present day but I don’t have a clear picture of how', 'Very good point! I didn’t quite piece together that her ‘holiday’ is what invigorated her desire to live rather than already having it established prior to the mission. \n\nToji really might be the biggest asshole in the series. He really killed her after she was no longer going to be the vessel 😭😭', 'It’s beautiful', ""I'm so late but here's my two cents: Getou had always seen non-sorcerers as lesser beings. If it wasn't Toji, Haibara dying (and or other sorcerers dying subsequently) would have triggered his spiral. His god complex has always been apparent even when he was a straight-laced sorcerer. I'm not saying this because I'm biased, I don't hate him. In fact, I'm obsessed with him. I just believe his mindset has always been wired to hate non-sorcerers, even if it wasn't to the extent of wanting to eradicate all of them."", 'I disagree. But that’s just me. \n\nBut watch how many people act “surprised” when Yuki’s plans start falling into place.', 'They key to Gojo\'s character development and his view on protecting those weaker than him or non-sorcerers lies in the conversations and interactions he had had with his best friend Geto. During the Hidden Inventory Arc the key moments in figuring out his changed attitude and resolutions lie in:\n\n\r(1) The conversation he has with Geto initially about protecting the weak. He says [""It\'s such a pain looking out for the weak""](https://i.imgur.com/nN17AjH.jpg) and gets into a mini disagreement with his best friend about it. Geto\'s view is that Jujutsu exists to protect the weak and Gojo just can\'t be bothered with that [righteous](https://i.imgur.com/fsi8Uqq.jpg) way of thinking. He\'s a prodigy with immense power and it\'s just not that deep for him. \n\n\r(2) His indifference when it comes to dealing with the cult that abducted Riko is another key point. He literally doesn\'t know what to do about the situation while holding her dead body. He can\'t decide whether to kill these people or not, whether he has any right to judge them and commit to carrying out punishment. He waits for Geto to arrive and make that decision for him asking, [""Should we kill these guys?](https://i.imgur.com/Clc7a5v.jpg) If we do it now I probably won\'t feel a single thing"". Geto tells him there\'s [no meaning](https://i.imgur.com/7bAnURd.jpg) in that and that [\'meaning\'](https://i.imgur.com/l9tHPvi.jpg) is something very important for Jujutsu Sorcerers.\n\n\r(3) Eventually after Geto strays from his initial path of protecting non-sorcerers, harboring his own disgust toward them, this again acts as a moral compass for Gojo. They have a last discussion before going their separate ways. Geto\'s last question asking Satoru [""Are you the strongest because you\'re Gojo Satoru, or are you Gojo Satoru because you\'re the strongest?""](https://i.imgur.com/iIGjP6M.jpg) is important because it makes Gojo realize that even though he has all the power in the world, there will be those that his power just [can\'t protect or save](https://i.imgur.com/lKjWoAU.jpg). It\'s at this point he starts finding his own resolution in being a Jujutsu Sorcerer, protecting the weak and taking the path opposite to Geto.\n\n\rSorry if the response was a little late. Wrote this on the fly but there are many other gems that can be found from the Hidden Inventory Arc and dialogue from these two in particular (Probably more cohesive interpretations too lol). Hope that helps though.', ""I do agree that people are probably inclined towards a certain nature since birth but saying they're determined to become that way is just wrong.\n\nAnd wdym by the second statement?"", 'Geto was inclined that way to me. And the star religious group was the trigger 🤷🏾\u200d♂️. \n\nYou’ll see eventually. Not sure how soon though.']",[]

Hakari brought it forward and forced them to close early on Yuji at that point in time. Other gambles you could take involve crossing the street when its busy with cars or reaching the elevator before it closes. It seems to fit Yuuta\'s comment of ""if he gets a lucky streak, he\'s even better than I am"" but it\'s also well-balanced, since perhaps the opponent hasn\'t taken a gamble that day, which would make the technique useless (although I\'m guessing he has other ways of applying it like Todo could be creative with his targets).', 'Easy, he sommons train doors to be use as a mahjong table.', ""What, have you never heard about X-Train, the legendary Vegas Casino Train??\n\n(I'm only half-joking btw)"", ""Yeah he had dark hair in all the teases and I'm pretty sure he's black"", 'Here u go.

Furthermore, if someone took away your technique to control metal, why would the car not function? \n\nThat’s my view on Panda. Yaga used cursed corpse manipulation to *build* panda. But panda does not have the CT cursed corpse manipulation. So there is no CT to take. Personally, I think Yaga’s CT extended only to the conception of Panda. But the minute a cursed corpse becomes independent and generates it’s own CE, Yaga has nothing to do with that.

I know this is theory and I was going to work on that. But because you know Reddit. I noticed if it wasn’t for Higuruma. The Comedian could have fight Yuji. But since that did not happen and the comedian has possibly Nanami’s technique. Nobara could be a potential fight. Especially in Shibuya it was hinted she saw how Nanami fights and how she was underpowered in that arc. She most likely wants to challenge herself against not someone strong as Hajime or Higuruma. Because a foreshadow from Mai to Nobara is this “pick your battles wisely”. Meaning if Nobara needs to grow stronger naturally, she needs to fight a player not to weak, but something that will test out her Reverse Curse Technique. That’s my predictions of the comedian’s fight']",[]
