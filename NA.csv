And I’m at 10 months and while I’m not thinking about using/relapse all day long like I was when I first got clean it definitely still crosses my mind and I have cravings everyday still multiple times a day, did that go away completely for you?

That’s amazing to hear how long you’ve been clean now and that you’ve never relapsed in all that time. Also incredibly inspiring for someone with far less clean time (10 months, will be 11 soon in a couple of days)  but in recovery also none the less. I was just curious as to if they ever go away completely after so much time, I should of known that they don’t but u guess was just naively hopeful. For me they are constantly recurring and I fight them off almost all dat long it feels like.

Never in my life have I had 4 month's. It really does WORK if you work it .Still going 6 meetings a week. Have more  freinds than I've had in years"", 'Hi Gabrielle,\n\nI\'m Roze and I\'m an addict. By the Grace of God / The Beneficence of the Goddess / The magick of the Faeries / The healiing power of Love / The Power of Grey Skull! (From the cartoon HeMan)  / Infinity and Beyond! (From Toy Story) / The Ever Creative, Expanding,  Benevolent Power of the Universe (From a very rudimentary understanding of Physiics) and mostly because of the amazing and simple power of one addict helping another, I haven\'t found it necessary to use any dope since the 4th day of March, 1990. I\'m always sure to include the part about the simple and redemptive power of one addict helping another, because I want new comers to know if that\'s *ALL* you can believe in right now, that\'s enough.\n\nAllow me the honor and priviledge of being among those welcoming you to this congregation of junkies who\'ve found another way to live. I hope tremendously that you\'ve had your fill of what it\'s like out there, and are ready to move on to something else. But I want you to know that if you relapse, no one will be mad at you, lecture you, or shame you. We\'ll just be really, realy glad you survived the experience if you do. A lot of people relapse and OD. Or they get busted and end up in jail. I hope terribly, Gabrielle, that you won\'t be one of those people. So I\'m asking you now honey, please don\'t do any more dope. We need you as much as you need us. But if you do, remember no one will be mad at you or disappointed in you. We just want to help. \n\nI love that you sent us a picture of the book, because reading the book is really, really, important. There\'s a lot of wisdom to be gleaned from those pages. I would suggest you read some of it every night before you fall asleep. And I would suggest that every morning, when you first open your eyes, you ask whatever God you can believe there *might* be to help you get through this day without doing any dope. \n\nMost of us come in with a lot of problems. I pretty much took a bull dozer to my life when I got clean.  I asked by best friend and room-mate to find another place to live. (He\'s been clean almost 20 years now.)  I quit my job because I was doing coke with my boss in her office. I had no idea where my next meal was coming from, but it always came. No matter what your problems are, the twelve steps are suggested as a program of recovery. If your car needs work, if you\'ve broken up with your lover, if you need a job or a new place to live, I can promise you that if you do those steps, all that stuff will take care of itself. I can promise you equally that if you *don\'t* do those twelve steps, you\'ll just go in circles, and that shit will happen again and again. So please, listen to us when we say “THESE ARE THE STEPS WE TOOK WHICH ARE SUGGESTED AS A PROGRAM OF RECOVERY.”\n\nHave you ever seen any of the Karate Kid movies? Having a sponsor will be like having your own Mr. Miagisan. It\'s absolutely the nicest thing you can do for yourself. \n\nI don\'t know what your DOC (Drug of Choice) was, so I\'m going to give you some general warnings. If it was meth, coke, or crank, there will be days when you feel like your feet don\'t touch the ground, and an equal number of days in the first year where you will feel like you\'re walking in quick sand. Just hang in there. I promise you on all that I hold sacred, that if you stick it out, it *will* get better. If it was opiates, then you\'ve made it through a really tough withdrawal, and have some pretty significant incentive to not do *that* again. \n\nTry to make 90 meetings in the first 90 days. If you\'re fortunate enough to live somewhere with *lots* of meetings, try to make 180 in 90 days. And then try to make at least a meeting a day for the first year. I strongly advise against getting married until you have 5 years clean. Who you screw is your business, but don\'t get yourself in a situation where you are reaping the consequences of anyone else\'s actions until you\'ve got enough time to really consider if this person is someone whose actions you want to be on the receiving end of the consequences for. I tell you that because I got married really close to after I had a year clean. It was a HUGE mistake, and well... there\'s an old Merle Haggard song that says, ""Tell ém that you finally drove me crazy, and I\'m somewhere untangling my mind.” I had to go away to do that, and I wouldn\'t wish that on anyone.\n\nDon\'t hesitate to ask for help with anything (and I do mean *anything*) you need help with. You won\'t know this until later, but there is no prrivilege higher than helping another addict. You\'ll be doing the person you ask a favor.\n\nThe first thirty days are the hardest, so try not to do them again. Remember that, so you don\'t have to do that again. \n\nWe\'re really amazingly glad you\'re here with us and not out there with them. \n\nFeel free to private message me if I can help you. \n\nAND FINALLY: WELCOME!\n\nThank you for allowing me the honor of welcoming you as you join us. Take time to think how much better your life has been in the last 30 days than itt was in the 30 days before you joined us. In fact, I recommend writing a list of the advantages of being clean so that you can pull it out and look at it if you find yourself slipping into craving. Also have a collection of people you can call on if you find yourself wanting to use. It happens. It also pases. Feel free to PM message me for my phone number. It will likely be long distance, but if you\'ve got a cell phone and you\'re in the Continental U.S., that shouldn\'t be a probem. \n\nBless you Gabrielle. I lost my sister to this disease February 18th. I needed to see a bright, shining new face in the crowd. And I\'ll be praying for you. Even if you don\'t believe in God, my prayers can\'t possibly *hurt* you.\n\nThank you for letting me share. Keep coming back.', 'Thank y’all ', 'Awesome! Its so worth it.', 'Congratulations!
